On 7 March 1876, Bell was granted US patent 174465A, for a method of transmitting speech by telegraphy—the telephone. On 10 March 1876, three days after the publication of his patent, Alexander Graham Bell made history with a peremptory instruction to his assistant Thomas Watson:  "Mr Watson, come here—I want to see you". Crackly and indistinct, but intelligible, the words were the first to be spoken over the telephone. Alexander Graham Bell proposed ‘ahoy’ as a standard phone greeting before Thomas Edison popularised the use of ‘hello’, which has stuck up to today. In 1877 Gardiner Greene Hubbard formed the Bell Telephone Company to exploit the invention, its direct descendant is now the telecommunications giant AT&T.  Alexander Graham Bell demonstrated the telephone to Queen Victoria in 1878, and in 1878 the Telephone Company Ltd was formed to market Bell's phones in Britain. In 1880 the first phone book was published, and an important court judgment granted the Post Office monopoly on telephone services. In the early 20th century telephones began to be installed in homes.In 1889, Almon Strowger designed a device to connect one caller to another without needing an operator to intervene. The first automatic telephone exchange using his design was opened in Indiana in 1891, and the system was widely adopted in its developed form in both Britain and the USA. In the UK, the Post Office opened the first automatic exchange on the public network at Epsom in Surrey in May 1912. 



A discerning feature of old phoes is the rotary dial, prior to that there was none and you would rely on the operator to connect. in places that lacked voltage a magento winding handle was on the phone to crank up some current
