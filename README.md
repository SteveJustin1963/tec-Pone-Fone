On 7 March 1876, Bell was granted US patent 174465A, for a method of transmitting speech by telegraphy—the telephone. On 10 March 1876, three days after the publication of his patent, Alexander Graham Bell made history with a peremptory instruction to his assistant Thomas Watson:  "Mr Watson, come here—I want to see you". Crackly and indistinct, but intelligible, the words were the first to be spoken over the telephone. Alexander Graham Bell proposed ‘ahoy’ as a standard phone greeting before Thomas Edison popularised the use of ‘hello’, which has stuck up to today. In 1877 Gardiner Greene Hubbard formed the Bell Telephone Company to exploit the invention, its direct descendant is now the telecommunications giant AT&T.  Alexander Graham Bell demonstrated the telephone to Queen Victoria in 1878, and in 1878 the Telephone Company Ltd was formed to market Bell's phones in Britain. In 1880 the first phone book was published, and an important court judgment granted the Post Office monopoly on telephone services. In the early 20th century telephones began to be installed in homes.In 1889, Almon Strowger designed a device to connect one caller to another without needing an operator to intervene. The first automatic telephone exchange using his design was opened in Indiana in 1891, and the system was widely adopted in its developed form in both Britain and the USA. In the UK, the Post Office opened the first automatic exchange on the public network at Epsom in Surrey in May 1912. 

From as early as 1836 onward, various suggestions and inventions of dials for sending telegraph signals were reported. After the first commercial telephone exchange was installed in 1878, the need for an automated, user-controlled method of directing a telephone call became apparent. Addressing the technical shortcomings, Almon Brown Strowger invented a telephone dial in 1891. A rotary dial typically features a circular construction. The shaft that actuates the mechanical switching mechanism is driven by the finger wheel, a disk that has ten finger holes aligned close to the circumference. The finger wheel may be transparent or opaque permitting the viewing of the face plate, or number plate below, either in whole, or only showing the number assignment for each finger hole. Early phones (in the mid to late 1960s) were built which continued to provide the same rotary-dial signalling on their PABX by using a separate converter to give 10-PPS, but were operated with buttons. Some of these, such as the GPO 726 or 728 can be distinguished from touch-tone phones by the lack of * and # keys and unusual key layout. Later so-called "Self-Contained" (SC) Keyphones used a line-powered electronic circuit within the phone to convert the keyed-in digits to give 10-PPS that was required to work on normal Strowger, Crossbar or Electronic public exchanges. 

In my time a discerning feature of old phones is the rotary dial, prior to that there was none and you would rely on the operator to connect sometimes using a magento and winding handle juice some current.
